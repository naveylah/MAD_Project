# Tutoring Mobile App

Education is very important especially at this current times fighting the pandemic.
We created an app to help students all around to have an interactive learning via the modules provided in the app. Not only that, it is a great platform for educated people of all skills and demographic to earn money by creating a fun environment for students to learn.

Objective:

1) To create a visually interactive media for education
2) To facilitate students that require additional assistance
3) To establish student-tutor relationship to exchange knowledge 
   through a visual medium.
4) For students to find subjects to enroll
